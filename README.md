# ev3_scratch_ita
Some fixes, updates and ITA translation

We added some extra features:
- added velocity to the **Steering Control block**;
- restored **Gyro sensor read value block** (angle, angular velocity options) - it was commented;
- created **Gyro sensor reset angle block**;
- fixed *Touch sensor Boolean synchronous block* (it returns if the button is pressed: true/false) - we created a new ext function that calls the usual whenButtonPressed function to avoid visualisation problems of the blocks after saving and loading the .sbx file. We commented the **deprecated** readTouchSensorPort function;
- created Block for changing the volume of the played note (only changes the global value of a variable)
-
In progress:
- [nothing]

Furthermore we translated in it **Italian**. You can find it in this [file](http://scollovati.github.io/ev3_scratch/ev3_scratch_ita.js): this is the URL that you need to load on ScratchX.

We tested these fixes and upgrades during a weeklong camp with 5 EV3 kits working simultaneously.

We work on the **master branch**.
We use the gyro-reset branch only for making pull requests to the original repo.
